#### Personality

_(Add 1 XP after adding a description of Sasha's personality here, along with notes for how to play Sasha, to help someone else play the character if needed.)_

#### Story

_The starting, background story:_

Sasha grew up nurtured by a loving family, far from the reach of the Empire
and, in truth, civilization. Every now and again the family would pack up and
move to another remote, uncivilized planet, full of unspoiled wilderness for
Sasha to explore. What Sasha came to realize is that her parents were
members of a group that would become the Rebel Alliance and were always
on the run from Imperial authorities. When she became an adult, Sasha joined
the Rebel Alliance as well, eager to do her part for the cause of galactic
harmony and democracy.

Sasha’s idealism did not survive contact with the enemy and neither did the
rest of her Rebel cell. While on a recon mission on the planet Onderon, Sasha
and her unit gave away their position, thanks to the dangerous native wildlife.
Imperial forces, their attention drawn by blaster fire, responded with heavy
artillery and a strike force of AT-ST walkers. When Sasha and her unit called for
evacuation, they were told that no support would be forthcoming. Sasha was
the only one to survive, hiding herself in the rugged hinterlands of the planet.

Her loyalty to the Rebel Alliance broken, Sasha began selling her skills as a scout
to the highest bidder. While business on Onderon was quite good, Sasha was
eager to leave the planet where she had seen so many of her friends die. An
opportunity arose when a Twi’lek bounty hunter named Oskara came to Onderon
and needed help tracking a bounty through wild country. Sasha led Oskara to her
quarry and, in return, Oskara gave her a ride to Mos Shuuta on Tatooine.

In its own way, Tatooine has a wilderness as harsh as any jungle world, and
Sasha was able to continue serving as a freelance scout, striking up friendships
with Oskara and Teemo’s lead mechanic, a human man named Mathus. The true
danger on Tatooine for Sasha was the rule of the Hutts and their minions; enough
of Sasha’s idealism remained that guiding an indentured servant through the
wilderness to a safehouse struck her as normal, even noble. When Teemo the
Hutt found out that it was Sasha who helped the servant escape, he was not
pleased–but apparently that had given Oskara an idea…

_Catching up through the first session:_

_(Add 5 XP after continuing Sasha's story to explain how she became a captive of the Trandoshan slaver Trex, ending with her bound and stowed in a hidden holding cell on the Krayt Fang. Was it her Imperial arrest warrants? Did she free the wrong slave, and this is payback? Does she even know why?)_
